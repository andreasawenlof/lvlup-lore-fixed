### Cloudinary API

The project uses the [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) API for handling media files like images and videos. The API key is stored in `env.py` for security purposes.


### Testing

The site was tested for:
- Functionality, responsiveness, and browser compatibility.
- Code quality using W3C validators (no HTML or CSS errors except the ).
- Performance, accessibility, and SEO using Lighthouse (all scores above 90%).

Detailed results are available in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

**Create a New Repository Using the Template:**
1. On the template repository page, look for the green button that says "Use this template". Click on this button.
2. You will be redirected to the "Create a new repository from gitpod-full-template" page.

**Configure Your New Repository:**
1. Repository name: Enter a name for your new repository.
2. Repository description (optional): Provide a brief description of your repository.
3. Privacy settings: Choose whether the repository should be Public (anyone can see this repository) or Private (you choose who can see this repository).
4. Leave the "Include all branches" checkbox unchecked if you just need the main branch; check it if you need all branches from the template.

**Create the Repository from the Template:**
1. Click the "Create repository from template" button to create your new repository with the contents of the Gitpod Full Template.

**Access Your New Repository:**
1. Once the repository is created, you will be redirected to your new repository page on GitHub.

</details>

### <a id="set-up-virtual-environments">Set Up Virtual Environments</a>
Requirements:
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**1. Python 3.x installed on your system.**

**Steps:**

**1. Open Your Command Line Interface:** This could be Terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows.
**2. Navigate to Your Project Directory:** Enter `cd path/to/your/project` to move into your project directory.
**3. Create the Virtual Environment:**
  - On Windows, type `python -m venv .venv`
  - On macOS or Linux, type `python3 -m venv .venv`
  This command creates a folder named `.venv` in your project directory containing the virtual environment.
**4. Activate the Virtual Environment:**
  - On Windows, type `.venv\Scripts\activate`
  - On macOS or Linux, type `source .venv/bin/activate`
  Activation changes the shell to use the environment’s settings and packages.
**5. Install Dependencies:**
  Once the environment is activated, install any required packages using `pip install package-name`.
**6. Capture Installed Dependencies:**
  To create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all installed packages, use `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This file can then be used to install all necessary packages into another environment or shared with other developers.
**7. Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**
  When finished, you can deactivate the environment by typing `deactivate`.

  ### Set Up Virtual Environments
For setting up a Python virtual environment, you can follow this guide: [Python Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

### <a id="create-django-project">Create Django Project</a>
Step-by-step guide on how to create a new Django project.
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

1. Install Django: Ensure you have Django installed on your system. If not, you can install it using pip:
  ```
  pip install django
  ```

2. Create a New Django Project: Use the django-admin command to create a new Django project. Replace `project_name` with the desired name for your project:
  ```
  django-admin startproject project_name
  ```

3. Navigate to the Project Directory: Change into the newly created project directory:
  ```
  cd project_name
  ```

4. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional): It's good practice to work within a virtual environment. You can create one using virtualenv:
  ```
  virtualenv venv
  ```

  Activate the virtual environment:
  - On Windows:
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On Unix or MacOS:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. Initialize Git (Optional): If you're using version control with Git, initialize a new Git repository:
  ```
  git init
  ```

6. Create .gitignore File (Optional): Create a .gitignore file to specify which files and directories Git should ignore. Typically, this includes the `venv` directory, database files, and sensitive configuration files.

7. Set Up Environment Variables: Create an `env.py` file to store sensitive information like secret keys and API keys. Add this file to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being pushed to your repository. An example `env.py` file might look like this:
  ```python
  import os

  os.environ.setdefault('SECRET_KEY', 'your_secret_key_here')
  os.environ.setdefault('DEBUG', 'True')
  ```

  Replace `'your_secret_key_here'` with a randomly generated secret key.

8. Configure Django Settings: Update the Django settings (`settings.py`) to use environment variables. For example, you can set the `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG` variables like this:
  ```python
  import os

  SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
  DEBUG = os.environ.get('DEBUG') == 'True'
  ```

  Ensure to import `env` at the top of `settings.py` to load environment variables.

9. Run Migrations: If your project uses a database, apply initial migrations:
  ```
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

10. Start the Development Server: Finally, start the Django development server to verify that everything is set up correctly:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see your new Django project in action.

- Add the following config vars:
  - SECRET_KEY: (Your secret key)
  - DATABASE_URL: (This should already exist with add on of postgres)
  - EMAIL_HOST_USER: (email address)
  - EMAIL_HOST_PASS: (email app password)
  - CLOUDINARY_URL: (cloudinary api url)
- Click the deploy tab
- Scroll down to Connect to GitHub and sign in / authorize when prompted

 The project is inspired by this [Dee Mac Recepie Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBjbty691eI&list=PLXuTq6OsqZjbCSfiLNb2f1FOs8viArjWy)

 I've also got very inspired by [Gamerant Gaming Website](https://gamerant.com/)
 I've used some advice from the PP4 example project. 
 The images I used from google images, just as placeholders to have some content, now i would never use this in a public website.
